"""Run every gate CI runs, in CI's order, and report honestly.

Why this exists rather than four commands in a row.

A gate is only useful if you notice it failed, and the usual way of running one
by hand hides exactly that:

    python3 tools/run_examples.py --check 2>&1 | tail -1

A pipeline's exit status is the LAST command's, so `tail` reports success no
matter what the gate said. The pipe is there for a good reason — these gates
print a line per example and you want the summary — and the cost is that a red
gate scrolls past under a green-looking last line. `set -o pipefail` fixes it;
remembering to type it every time does not. And the array lookup people reach
for instead is shell-specific: `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` is bash's spelling, and under
zsh -- which is what runs here -- it quietly expands to the empty string rather
than erroring, so it prints `exit=` and reads like a stumble instead of a wrong
answer. (zsh's own array is lowercase and 1-indexed: `${pipestatus[1]}`.) That
is the same failure one level down, which is the argument for not piping at all.

So: no pipes here. Each gate runs through subprocess, its status is kept, its
output is shown only when it fails, and this script exits non-zero if any of
them did.

    python3 tools/check_all.py              # the working tree
    python3 tools/check_all.py --staged     # the tree your next commit makes
    python3 tools/check_all.py --committed  # what CI will actually see
    python3 tools/check_all.py --selftest   # prove a failure is still reported

--committed is the one worth knowing about. CI checks out the commit, not your
directory, and the two differ in both directions: an untracked file makes your
tree red where CI is green (someone else's half-built lesson), and an untracked
file that a committed page LINKS to makes CI red where your tree is green. This
flag extracts HEAD into a temporary directory and runs the gates there.

--staged is the one between them, and it is the one to run immediately before
committing. --committed archives HEAD and so cannot see the index at all: it is
green and says nothing about the commit you are about to make. --staged writes
the index out with `git write-tree` and gates that. In a checkout several
sessions share, that gap is where the damage happens -- `git add` on a shared
file takes a colleague's in-flight lines with it.
